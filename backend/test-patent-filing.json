  "inventionTitle": "AI-Powered Smart Home Energy Management System",
  "inventionField": "Artificial Intelligence",
  "inventionDescription": "An intelligent system that uses machine learning algorithms to optimize home energy consumption by predicting usage patterns and automatically adjusting appliances for maximum efficiency while maintaining user comfort.",
  "technicalProblem": "Current home energy management systems lack predictive capabilities and cannot adapt to user behavior patterns, leading to inefficient energy consumption and higher electricity bills.",
  "proposedSolution": "The invention uses AI algorithms to learn from historical energy usage data, weather patterns, and user preferences to predict optimal energy consumption schedules and automatically control smart appliances.",
  "advantages": "1. Reduces energy consumption by up to 30%\n2. Learns and adapts to user behavior\n3. Integrates with existing smart home devices\n4. Provides real-time energy usage insights\n5. Reduces carbon footprint",
  "priorArt": "Existing smart thermostats like Nest provide basic learning capabilities but don't offer comprehensive whole-home energy optimization across all appliances.",
